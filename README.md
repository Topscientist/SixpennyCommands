## Q&A
**Q: Is this mod paid/has a paid version?**

A: Nope, this mod is completely free and there is no hidden paid version of it. What you see here is the full thing.

**Q: Can I use this on my own realm?**

A: Yes, of course! This is what it is for :)

**Q: Can I modify/re-distribute this?**

A: Yes and no. You can re-distribute your own version, however you must credit this original repository, use the same liscence and may not create a paid/paywalled version.

**Q: Can I use this on cracked/pirated versions of minecraft?**

A: Theoretically. However, we will not provide support for such. Cracked/pirated versions of minecraft are illegal and thus we will not provide support for them.

**Q: Does this mod use telementary and/or send any kind of information back to you?**

A: Nope. This mod is privacy-friendly in that sense. This mod collects no information on how it is used nor transmits any information (back to me).

**Q: Does this work on bedrock dedicated servers?**

A: I am not sure as I am yet to test such (Sorry!). If bedrock dedicated servers work in a similiar way to realms then yes, if not then no/possibly. If someone is able to test this please let me know!

**Q: How often are versions released?**

A: As and when. Unfortunately I am also very busy with other projects, however I aim to keep this project useable and "online" as such. Expect major releases/feature upgrades every 6-7 weeks or how desperately people want them.

**Q: Is this project "owned" by anyone/can I become a developer for it?**

A: Nope, this project is not "owned" by anyone, it is entirely independent and volunteer-based. If you wish to become a developer please feel free! Join the discord server above and ping me in the sixpennycommands channel with your application request and I'll look into it. Please note that any position on the developer team will be entirely voluntary (I.E: Not paid).

**Q: Do you make any money from this project?**

A: Nope.

**Q: Why did you make this project & Why is it called "SixpennyCommands"?**

A: I am a realm owner myself and wanted a system to be able to manage my realm more eaily and it is called SixpennyCommands as it relates to my minecraft IGN (Username).
