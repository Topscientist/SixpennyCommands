## Q&A
**Q: Is this mod paid/has a paid version?**
A: Nope, this mod is completely free and there is no hidden paid version of it. What you see here is the full thing.

**Q: Can I use this on my own realm?**
A: Yes, of course! This is what it is for :)

**Q: Can I modify/re-distribute this?**
A: Yes and no. You can re-distribute your own version, however you must credit this original repository and may not create a paid version.

**Q: Can I use this on cracked/pirated versions of minecraft?**
A: Theoretically. However, we will not provide support for such. Cracked/pirated versions of minecraft are illegal and thus we will not provide support for them. We/I may implement code to prevent this mod running on cracked/pirated versions of the game at our/my discretion.
